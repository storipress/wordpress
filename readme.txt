#STORIPRESS MIGRATOR - MIGRATE YOUR CONTENT TO STORIPRESS IN 1 CLICK

The official Storipress plugin allows you connect Storipress to WordPress to manage your blog posts, as well as export your WordPress categories and content to Storipress. Currently, we're working to have this plugin support Yoast and ACF for bi-directional sync of custom fields. Want to accelerate the release of this feature? Open an issue or contribute directly in our git repo.

== Description ==
This plugin is currently in early beta. Help us make the plugin better by opening issues in our [Github Repo](https://github.com/storipress/wp-storipress-exporter/issues)!

##Features overview
The Storipress Migrator plugin will export as much blog and publication data as it can into a clean set of exported files.

- Posts, pages, tags and authors are all automatically exported and recreated for Storipress
- Content categories will be converted automatically into desks.
- Storipress comes with native Disqus comments.
- Storipress does not have built-in comments, but it does integrate with Disqus. Provided that your URL is the same on Storipress, Disqus will automatically migrate your comments across to Storipress.
- Exporting meta is only supported for users using Yoast (for now). If you use another SEO plugin, please create an issue in our Github repo, or modify the plugin and create a pull request!
